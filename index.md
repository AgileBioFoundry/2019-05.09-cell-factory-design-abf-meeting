## General information

This brownbag seminar covers the basics of constraint-based modeling of metabolism with a focus on cell factory engineering. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

**Who**: The course is aimed at scientists, engineers and other researchers. You do need a basic working knowledge of Python in order to follow the course.

**Where**:

* Thursday, May 9, 2019, 1pm-2pm EMSL 1585

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (the setup instruction can be found [here](setup)). They are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's Code of Conduct.
