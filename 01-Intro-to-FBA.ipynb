    " We see from the previous exercise that if the cell wanted to produce the product, then there is a pathway that enables both growth and bioproduction.  But cells don't want to produce bioproducts, they just want to grow.  How can we align the cellular objective with our engineering objective? Well, by looking at the difference in flux distributions between optimal biomass growth and optimal bioproduct yield, it seems that there is a decision point at the production of $B$. To optimize growth, $B$ combines with $E$ to generate 2 moles of $D$. On the other hand to optimize bioproduct, 2 moles of $B$ split to form $C$ and $F$.   Perhaps we can alter the environmental conditions to induce bioproduction. In the ABC model, let's imagine that $E$ plays the role of oxygen in the metabolism of a facultative aerobe: having some makes the growth rate increase, but it is not strictly necessary for growth. What happens to the flux distribution if the cell tries to grow without $E$ (an-$E$-robically?)  Will this result in the desired pathway being utilized?\n",

    "As you can see, when there are only two fluxes, FVA forms the tightest rectangle around the actual solution, which is a polygon. FVA forms a parallelopiped around the actual solution, which is a polyhedra in 3 dimensions, and in general, FVA forms a hyperrectangle around the polytope in $n$ dimensions. The work required to find an exact solution, unfortunately, grows exponentially in the number of reactions, but for genome-scale models, FVA is usually good enough."
